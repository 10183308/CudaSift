This is the fourth version of a SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) implementation using CUDA for GPUs from NVidia. The first version is from 2007 and GPUs have evolved since then. This version is considerably faster than the previous versions and has been optimized for Tesla K40c using larger images.

On a Tesla K40 GPU the code takes about 5.5 ms on a 1280x960 pixel image and 7.2 ms on a 1920x1080 pixel image, while the third version required 11.2 ms and 14.5 ms respectively. An additional 1.5 ms and 1.0 ms respective is needed for images transfers from CPU to GPU. There is also code for brute-force matching of features and homography computation that takes about 5 ms and 3 ms for two sets of around 1250 SIFT features each.

The code relies on CMake for compilation and OpenCV for image containers. OpenCV can however be quite easily changed to something else. The code can be relatively hard to read, given the way things have been parallelized for maximum speed.

The code is free to use for non-commercial applications. If you use the code for research, please refer to the following paper.

Computational cost (in milliseconds) on different GPUs:

                 1280x960  1920x1080   GFLOPS  Bandwidth
Tesla K40           5.5       7.2       4291      288
GeForce GTX 570     7.5      11.0       1405      152

Obviously, there is room for more improvements on the K40.
